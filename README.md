# Remote-telegram-controller
This is a telegram bot that can control your computer remotely ***(only for Windows)***

To use this script you should create your bot with help from BotFather, copy your token and paste it into "token" variable in my script. 
(How do I get my token? https://www.siteguarding.com/en/how-to-get-telegram-bot-api-token)

Then start app.py by running the following command:
    `py app.py`
 and test your bot. If you find any bug or trash code, create a separate branch, commit your suggested changes, and open a pull request that I will review.

To use this bot in your everyday life you can convert app.py to app.exe using auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/)
Then you should add app.exe file to your startup list (https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/ru-ua/000124550/how-to-add-app-to-startup-in-windows-10)

Congrats!!! Bon app√©tit!
