# Remote-telegram-controller
This is a telegram bot that can control your computer remotely ***(only for Windows)***


***Опиши здесь где нужно взять token.***

To use this script you should create your bot with help from BotFather, copy your token and paste it into "token" variable in my script.

Then start app.py by running the following command:
    `py app.py`
 and test your bot. If you find any bug or trash code, create a separate branch, commit your suggested changes, and open a pull request that I will review.

To use this bot in your everyday life you can convert app.py to app.exe using auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/)
Then you should add app.exe file to your startup list (https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/ru-ua/000124550/how-to-add-app-to-startup-in-windows-10)

Congrats!!! Bon appétit!
