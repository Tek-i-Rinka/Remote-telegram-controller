# Remote-telegram-controller
It is telegram bot that can control your computer remotely (only for Windows)

To use this script you should create your bot with help from BotFather, copy yours token and paste it to "token" variable in my script

Then start app.py and test your bot. If you find any bug or trash code, write commit, I`ll fix it. 

To use this bot in your everyday life you can convert app.py to app.exe using auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/)
Then you should add app.exe file to your startup list (https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/ru-ua/000124550/how-to-add-app-to-startup-in-windows-10)

Congrats!!! Bon app√©tit!
